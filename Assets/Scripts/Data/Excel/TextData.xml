  <TextData ID="10002" eng="Tadashi: So my splattered blood and fall from Mt. Fukaido was all a farce, then? I get it, I lost, I’ll pay my penance now." />
  <TextData ID="10003" eng="Yokai: No, that all was very much real. You did lose, and you did die. I have pulled you from the aether beyond, and instilled you with the light of life once more." />
  <TextData ID="10004" eng="Tadashi: Pulled from Yomi’s gates? Why?" />
  <TextData ID="10005" eng="Yokai: There is too much unspent potential in your heart." />
  <TextData ID="10006" eng="Tadashi: Yeah, everyone saw so much potential in me. And look what happened." />
  <TextData ID="10007" eng="Tadashi: I defied one of the Shogun’s orders, refused to kill my own sensei, and that bastard cast me out for it!" />
  <TextData ID="10008" eng="Tadashi: Exiled, then stabbed through the heart in my failure for revenge." />
  <TextData ID="10009" eng="Tadashi: Not sure which is worse." />

  <TextData ID="10013" eng="Tadashi: What in Yomi’s rot is Luciferin?" />
  <TextData ID="10014" eng="Yokai: It is the lifeblood of my light, and what powers your new weapon." />
  <TextData ID="10015" eng="Tadashi: What new weapon?" />

  <TextData ID="10018" eng="Yokai: Impressive, isn’t it? Though due to its nature, you must use it responsibly." />
  <TextData ID="10019" eng="Yokai: Find my fireflies around you, use them to charge the weapon, and use it to strike true when it matters most." />
  <TextData ID="10020" eng="Yokai: Now go and begin your journey. There is someone waiting just outside this grove that I think you’ll be happy to test your newfound power on." />
